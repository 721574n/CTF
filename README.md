## Overview
This repository includes a set of executable challenges, each simulating aspects inspired by real-world adversary scenarios. These challenges aim to help you understand various cybersecurity techniques, such as key generation, reverse engineering, debugging, and cryptographic analysis. The included executables are:

- `CTF_Vice.exe`
- `CTF_Phantom.exe`
- `CTF_Vidar.exe`
- `CTF_LockBit.exe`
- `CTF_Amos.exe`
- `CTF_Cyclix.exe`

## Challenges
Below is a brief description of each challenge:

- **CTF_Vice.exe**
  - Difficulty: Moderate
  - Participants are required to develop a key generator. Reverse engineer the executable to understand its key generation algorithm and implement a solution that produces valid keys.

- **CTF_Phantom.exe**  
  - Difficulty: Hard
  - The objective is to extract the hidden key embedded within the executable and understand how it works. This challenge emphasizes static and dynamic analysis techniques.

- **CTF_Vidar.exe** 
  - Difficulty: Moderate 
  - The objective is to extract the hidden key embedded within the executable and understand how it works. This challenge emphasizes static and dynamic analysis techniques.

- **CTF_LockBit.exe**  
  - Difficulty: Moderate
  - The objective is to extract the hidden key embedded within the executable and understand how it works. This challenge emphasizes static and dynamic analysis techniques.

- **CTF_Amos.exe**  
  - Difficulty: Moderate
  - The objective is to extract the hidden key embedded within the executable and understand how it works. This challenge emphasizes static and dynamic analysis techniques.

- **CTF_Cyclix.exe** 
  - Difficulty: Easy
  - The objective is to extract the hidden key embedded within the executable and understand how it works. This challenge emphasizes static and dynamic analysis techniques.

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Educational Purpose**  
   These challenges are intended for learning and research in cybersecurity. They should only be used in legal, controlled environments, such as isolated virtual machines or dedicated lab setups.

2. **Environment Setup**  
   - Use a virtual machine or sandboxed environment to run the executables safely.  
   - Equip yourself with tools like debuggers, disassemblers, and decompilers for an effective analysis.

3. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - Keep detailed notes of your approaches, methodologies, and findings.  
   - Share your insights through the repository’s issue tracker or discussion forums to benefit the community.

4. **Collaboration**  
   Contributions in the form of write-ups, improved challenge implementations, or additional resources are encouraged. Submit pull requests or open issues for collaboration.
